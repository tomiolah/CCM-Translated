All praise to You eternal Lord
Clothed in a garb of flesh and blood
You chose a manger for Your throne
While worlds on worlds are Yours alone

Once did the skies before You bow
A virgin's arm cradle You now
And angels who in You rejoice
Now listen for Your infant voice
They sing

(chorus)
Glory in the highest
For there's no other name by which we can be saved
Glory in the highest
Heaven and Earth forever will proclaim
God has come to Earth

O little Child You are our guest
That weary ones in You may rest
Forlorn and lowly is Your birth
That we may rise to Heaven from Earth
Singing

(chorus)
Glory in the highest
For there's no other name by which we can be saved
Glory in the highest
Heaven and Earth forever will proclaim
God has come to Earth

O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him

(chorus)
Glory in the highest
For there's no other name by which we can be saved
Glory in the highest
Heaven and Earth forever will proclaim

Glory in the highest
For there's no other name by which we can be saved
Glory in the highest
Heaven and Earth forever will proclaim

And there's no other name by which we can be saved
And Heaven and Earth forever will proclaim

God has come to Earth
God has come to Earth
God has come to Earth
