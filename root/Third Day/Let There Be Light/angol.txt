You spoke and your words brought us life
You saw and you said that it was good
And somehow we have broken your design
And Father we are praying that you would

Speak to us once more
Bring your life again

Let there be light
Where there is darkness
Let there be hope
When there is none
Let there be peace
In the midst of sorrow
Let there be love
To bring us back home
To bring us back home

Let all behold the precious lamb of God
Who takes away the sins of the world
Oh, none of us are worthy of your love
But still you offer more than we deserve

Let there be light
Where there is darkness
Let there be hope
When there is none
Let there be peace
In the midst of sorrow
Let there be love
To bring us back home
To bring us back home
To bring us back home
Let there be light
To bring us back home

There is one light
There is one saviour of the world
There is one hope
His name is Jesus, Jesus

There is one light
There is one saviour of the world
There is one hope
His name is Jesus, Jesus

Let there be light
Where there is darkness
Let there be hope
When there is none
Let there be peace
In the midst of sorrow
Let there be love
To bring us back home
To bring us back home
To bring us back home
