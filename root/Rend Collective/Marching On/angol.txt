Let our praises remind all the darkness
Of how great and how mighty our God is
For the battle belongs to the Lord and no one else

We are standing in holy defiance
We’re declaring aloud in the silence
That the battle belongs to the Lord and no one else

We’ll sing hallelujah
For all Hell to hear
Shout out hosanna
Above every fear
Strongholds will crumble
Like castles of sand
We are marching on
We’re marchin' on

Your unstoppable kingdom advances
As we take back the ground from the darkness
The battle belongs to the Lord and no one else

You’re the banner we raise in the chaos
No, the gates of Hell won't stand against us
The battle belongs to the Lord and no one else

In the chaos, the crisis, the troubles, the trials, the shadows, the sorrows, the long nights, the hard fight
We are the prophets, the voice in the darkness
Declaring the battle is Yours
