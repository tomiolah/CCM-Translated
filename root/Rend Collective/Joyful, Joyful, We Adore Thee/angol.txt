Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee
Opening to the Sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
fill us with the light of day

Rejoice, Rejoice our God is here with us
Emmanuel, our God is still with us

All Thy works with joy surround Thee
Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays
Stars and angels sing around Thee
center of unbroken praise
Field and forest, vale and mountain
Flow'ry meadow, flashing sea
chanting bird and flowing fountain
call us to rejoice in Thee

Rejoice, Rejoice our God is here with us
Emmanuel, our God is still with us

Thou art giving and forgiving
ever blessing, ever blest
well-spring of the joy of living
ocean-depth of happy rest
Thou the Father, Christ our Brotherâ€”
all who live in love are Thine
Teach us how to love each other
lift us to the Joy Divine

Rejoice, Rejoice our God is here with us
Emmanuel, our God is still with us

Mortals join the mighty chorus
which the morning stars began
Father-love is reigning o'er us
brother-love binds man to man.
Ever singing, march we onward
victors in the midst of strife
joyful music lifts us sunward
in the triumph song of life

Rejoice, Rejoice our God is here with us
Emmanuel, our God is still with us
