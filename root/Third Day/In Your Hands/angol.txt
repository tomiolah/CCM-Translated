When I'm all dried up
And I'm all worn out
You runneth over my cup
When you pour love down

When I'm lost and alone all by myself
Barely breathing yet I find you there
You have always been there
You were always there

In your hands I can move the mountains
In your hands weakness becomes strong
In your hands along with all creation
In your hands I found where I belong
I found where I belong
In your hands I found where I belong
In your hands

When I'm down in the valley
The valley of the shadow
I shall not want
I shall not fear
As long as I know

When I'm lost and alone all by myself
Barely breathing yet I find you there
You have always been there

In your hands I can move mountains
In your hands weakness becomes strong
In you hands along with all creation
In your hands I found where I belong

Let every knee bow down
Let every voice cry out
Let all our hope be found
In your hands

Let every knee bow down
Let every voice cry out
Let all our hope be found

In your hands I can move mountains
In your hands weakness becomes strong
In your hands along with all creation
In your hands I found where I belong
In your hands I found where I belong
In your hands
