I can feel the memories again
In this field of foreign oxygen
I'm awake without the medicine
I forgot the joy of suffering
I can feel the memories again
In this field of foreign oxygen
I'm awake without the medicine
I forgot the joy of suffering
Suffering

I lose it all to find you now
To find you now
I lose it all to find you now
Find you now
I lose it all to find you now
Life is loud, all around
Sight and sound
Lost and found
Cross and crown

The Bible
The Bible tells me so
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
The Bible tells me so
The Bible tells me so
