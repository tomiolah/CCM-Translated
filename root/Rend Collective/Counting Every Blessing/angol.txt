I was blind, now I'm seeing in colour
I was dead, now I’m living forever
I had failed, but You were my Redeemer
I’ve been blessed beyond all measure

I was lost, now I’m found by the Father
I’ve been changed from a ruin to treasure
I’ve been given a hope and a future
I’ve been blessed beyond all measure

I am counting every blessing
Counting every blessing
Letting go and trusting
When I cannot see

I am counting every blessing
Counting every blessing
Surely every season
You are good to me

You were there in the valley of shadows
You were there in the depth of my sorrows
You're my strength, my hope for tomorrow
I’ve been blessed beyond all measure

Surely Your goodness pursues me
Surely Your heart is still for me
I will remember Your mercies
All my days
Through every storm and gale
